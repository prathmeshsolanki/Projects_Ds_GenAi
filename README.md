Daily Mood & Productivity Tracker — Built with Python
This is a unique console-based project where you log your mood, record your completed tasks, get a productivity score, and receive a motivational quote.
It uses everything I’ve learned in my 1st month of Python: functions, OOP, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, file handling, and more!

Features:
- Mood-based scoring
- Task tracking
- Random motivational quotes
- File saving
- Object-oriented structure
